                    The Central Government War Headquarters (CGWHQ) is a 35-acre (14 ha)[1] 
                    complex built 120 feet (37 m) underground[2] as the United Kingdom's 
                    emergency government war headquarters – the hub of the country's 
                    alternative seat of power outside London during a nuclear war or 
                    conflict with the Soviet Union. It is in Corsham, Wiltshire, in a 
                    former Bath stone quarry known as Spring Quarry, under the present-day 
                    MoD Corsham.</p>

                    
                <p className="text-dark text-justify">In 1940, during the Second World War, the site was acquired by the 
                    Minister of Aircraft Production and used as an underground 
                    engine factory.[1] The war headquarters was commissioned in 
                    1955, after approval by Prime Minister Anthony Eden.[1] However, 
                    it became outdated shortly after it was built, due to intercontinental 
                    ballistic missiles being able to target it, and the formulation of other 
                    plans (such as PYTHON). Nevertheless, the complex continued to have a 
                    role in war plans and remained in operation for 30 years.

                <p className="text-dark text-justify">
                    Over 1 kilometre (0.62 mi; 3,300 ft) in length, and with 
                    over 60 miles (97 km) of roads, the site was designed to 
                    accommodate the Prime Minister, the entire Cabinet Office, other 
                    civil servants, and domestic support staff.

                    Blast-proof and self-sufficient, the complex could accommodate 
                    up to 4,000 people in complete isolation from the outside world 
                    for up to three months. The underground city was equipped with 
                    all the facilities needed to survive: from hospitals, canteens, 
                    kitchens and laundries to storerooms for supplies, accommodation 
                    areas and offices. An underground lake and treatment plant could 
                    provide drinking water, and twelve tanks could store the fuel 
                    required to keep the four generators in the underground power 
                    station running for up to three months. The air within the complex 
                    could be kept at a constant humidity and heated to around 20 °C (68 °F). 
                    It was also equipped with the second-largest telephone exchange in Britain,
                    a BBC studio from which the PM could address the nation, and an internal 
                    Lamson Tube system that could relay messages throughout the complex, 
                    using compressed air.</p>
